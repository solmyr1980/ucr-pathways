# Counselor completeness and exceptions: first-stage audit

Status: in progress. Batch 1 completed on 7 October 2026; ten scope exclusions researched individually. No exception has yet received substantive audit.

## Scope and method

This audit follows the current Master Specification §4.1 and Production Instructions §§4.1 and 4.4. A target belongs to counselor production only when production_eligible=true, production_order is nonblank, and programme_type=standard. Non-standard degree structures remain legitimate registry targets. The audit tests the factual attributes behind exclusion without reconsidering the presentation policy itself.

The starting population is the normalized registry, not the upstream DUO/RIO population. Existing normalization decisions, post-build corrections, source-row crosswalks and offering-ID crosswalks were inspected for every audited target, then checked against fresh official evidence. Ten cases were selected in ascending registry order. Future batches resume from the explicit pending queue in the JSON dataset.

The classification applies only to the stated audit scope. Resolving an external curriculum normally requires reassess-exception rather than automatically reprocess-as-comparison. An outdated finding requires historical evidence of a later change; temporal uncertainty must be retained where that distinction cannot be established. No UCR curriculum was rebuilt, and no mechanical production validation was repeated.

## Population and reconciliation

| Population | Total | Audited | Pending |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Normalized registry targets | 460 | — | — |
| In-scope targets with canonical records | 441 | — | — |
| Completed comparisons | 301 | Outside this stage | — |
| Completed exceptions | 140 | 0 | 140 |
| Excluded normalized targets | 19 | 10 | 9 |
| First-stage audit cases | 159 | 10 | 149 |

All 441 in-scope IDs have a canonical filename; there are no missing in-scope IDs, duplicate record filenames or out-of-scope canonical records. The review-index ID set matches both registry scope and canonical filenames. Status totals use that current generated index; all 140 indexed exceptions were additionally read directly to verify ID, exception status and formal type. Enumeration does not constitute a substantive exception audit.

| Formal exception type | Corpus total | Substantively audited |
|---|---:|---:|
| external-programme-unresolved | 20 | 0 |
| no-defensible-ucr-match | 117 | 0 |
| registry-exception | 3 | 0 |

## Batch findings

| Finding | Count |
|---|---:|
| confirmed | 10 |
| incorrect | 0 |
| outdated | 0 |
| still-unresolved | 0 |

| Required action | Count |
|---|---:|
| none | 10 |
| reprocess-as-comparison | 0 |
| reassess-exception | 0 |
| correct-registry-and-reprocess | 0 |
| research-again-later | 0 |

All ten existing exclusions are confirmed within the current scope rules. No case requires a correction or reprocessing, and none is classified as outdated. Confirmation does not imply that UCR lacks relevant courses or that excluding every joint degree is academically necessary. Active joint degrees are excluded by the approved presentation rule.

For Groningen cases, the shared structural evidence establishes the combination bachelor and its credit-sharing structure. The 180-EC size of the philosophy award is not the total load of a standalone two-degree programme. Each named track was separately verified against the current bachelor documents.

## Evidence for each audited exclusion

### cp-000007 — Double bachelor BSc² in Econometrics and Economics

Institution: Erasmus University Rotterdam. Audit scope: Programme type, double-degree identity and merged source provenance.

Exclusion trigger: `programme_type='double-bachelor'`. The relevant rule is Master Specification §4.1 / Production Instructions §4.1.

Official evidence confirms the merged target is a 264-EC double bachelor. Its double-bachelor type correctly excludes it under the standard-only presentation rule.

Provenance: source worksheet row(s) 9, 10; normalization step2-resolved; decision cases rc-0001, rc-0002. Source-row and offering-ID sets exactly agree with the normalized target.

Current official sources (checked 7 October 2026):

Result: confirmed; required action: none; exclusion should remain. No material factual question remains unresolved within this case’s audit scope.

### cp-000012 — RASL Dual Degree Philosophy and WdKA

Institution: Erasmus University Rotterdam; Willem de Kooning Academy. Audit scope: Exact Philosophy/WdKA route, dual-degree structure and current admissions.

Exclusion trigger: `programme_type='dual-degree-route'`. The relevant rule is Master Specification §4.1 / Production Instructions §4.1.

The exact Philosophy/WdKA route remains a five-year combination of two bachelors. Its dual-degree-route classification correctly excludes it.

Provenance: source worksheet row(s) 15; normalization step2-resolved; decision cases rc-0003. Source-row and offering-ID sets exactly agree with the normalized target.

### cp-000147 — Urban Sustainability Studies (joint degree)

Institution: Maastricht University. Audit scope: Joint award, current UM programme identity and local start-year context.

Exclusion trigger: `programme_type='joint-degree'`. The relevant rule is Master Specification §4.1 / Production Instructions §4.1.

UM remains a degree-awarding YUFE partner in this active joint bachelor. Its joint-degree exclusion is justified; the Heerlen start year differs from the alliance launch.

Provenance: source worksheet row(s) 160; normalization step2-resolved; decision cases rc-0014. Source-row and offering-ID sets exactly agree with the normalized target.

## Remaining work and next batch

The remaining nine exclusions, in order, are: cp-000190, cp-000195, cp-000197, cp-000202, cp-000234, cp-000307, cp-000417, cp-000430, cp-000460. All 140 exception records remain pending, beginning with cp-000040. The JSON dataset enumerates every pending case, with its programme identity and formal exception type where applicable.

The next batch of ten should finish the nine exclusions and then audit exception cp-000040. Do not reinterpret pending inventory entries as audit findings. Preserve completed findings and append subsequent case entries to these same two artifacts.

At overall completion, reconcile completed entries by the composite key audit_population + counselor_programme_id. A target appearing in both populations requires one entry for each population; it must not disappear through ID-only deduplication. This batch has ten unique completed keys, no duplicated keys, and a complete disjoint pending inventory of 149 cases. Coverage is 10/19 exclusions and 0/140 exceptions; the exhaustive audit is not yet complete.

The second-stage audit will independently assess UCR feasibility for every current no-defensible-ucr-match record. First-stage confirmation of those exceptions will establish only their external-programme basis. Scope-exclusion findings make no UCR feasibility judgment.

## Production-data boundary

Only this report and data/counselor/qc/stage1-completeness-exceptions.json are written. No registry file, comparison, exception decision, production rule or other existing production data is changed.
